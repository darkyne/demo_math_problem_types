    This task show exercises for all the math problem types, mainly showing format examples.

    These problem types show a little format example near the answer box.
    On the teacher task edit page, each problem type shows a little text with explanation in addition to the format example via a small button.

    Types are the following:

    **math**: This is the basic problem type that was initially used in the math plugin. Used for general math expressions, numerical values, equations or inequalities. It allows to define an (absolute) tolerance.

    **math_vector**: This is used to encode vectors with format such as a,b,c. Each element must be a mathematical expression wich can include constants, numerical values and variables.

    **math_matrix**: This uses the same principle as vectors but for matrix with format such as a,b:c,d.

    **math_interval**: This is specific for intervals answers like function domains with format such as (0,5]U[10,12]. The symbols [ and ( are respectively for included and excluded.

            What is the area of a circle with a 5cm radius ?
            The solution is expressed in cm^2.
            A tolerance of 0.1 is accepted.

            The answer can be encoded as 25π.
            Since the numerical value would be 78.5398163397 any value with a 0.1 distance will be accepted.
            So, for example, 78.5 is also valid.
